              <P>Since the starting of Maximum Eclipse College (M.E.C) in 2020, it has been a long journey training youths on computer packages skills to make them realize their goals. We have seen the need of a Vocational training Center institution with equipped modern equipmentâ€™s. </P><p>The worse situations of school dropouts arise especially when the drought season comes. Reason being in Rongai sub-county, and some parts of Baringo the large population is integrated IDPs that involves Turkana community and since they have no own farms, they end up being economically, poorly affected.</P>
          
          <p>The situation is calling for multi-sector action to provide the teenage girls and boys out of school with Vocational Skills and Leadership abilities. This will empower both to become strong, change agents of the community and help in disjointing the circle of poverty among society at large.<br>
            
            
            <br>Maximum Eclipse College (M.E.C) felt called to play a role by establishing a Vocational Training Center and Skills Development Program for the Teenage in Rongai sub-county in Kampi ya moto Location, within Nakuru -Kenya and its environs.</p><p>It is against these conditions that M.E.C College was created and started in Nakuru County, Rongai Sub-County and its surrounding to create Job opportunities and empower youths in and out of school in order to make them attain basic Education of the Advanced Information Technology through Vocational training. So far 44 youths, 38 widows and 88 youths have been trained in the last 3 years. Whereby 2 girls who where out of school got employment as cashiers in the some of the supermarkets within Nairobi City.</P>
